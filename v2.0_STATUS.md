That's a great question. The `v2.0` branch includes a massive overhaul with many new features that we've worked on. Here’s a quick summary of what's **included and complete** in this new version:

*   **A Modern `rich` CLI:** The entire user interface has been rebuilt for a better experience.
*   **Advanced Compression:** More flexible and powerful compression options for both `.zip` and `.tar` files.
*   **GitHub Remote Offloading:** You can directly upload your backups to GitHub Releases.
*   **Filtered Local Copy:** A new `--copy-to` feature lets you copy a directory while respecting the ignore rules.
*   **Interactive Prompts & Ignore File Management:** The CLI is more user-friendly with interactive prompts and the ability to generate or specify an ignore file.
*   **CI/CD and Documentation:** The test pipeline is fixed and the `README.md` is fully updated.

The most significant feature that we discussed but is **missing or incomplete** is:

1.  **Google Drive Integration:** While the goal was to support multiple remote providers "like GitHub, Google Drive," only the GitHub functionality is fully implemented. I've created a placeholder `GoogleDriveStorage` class, so the foundation is there, but the actual logic to authenticate with Google's API and upload files still needs to be built. This would be the biggest missing piece to fully realize the initial vision for remote offloading.

Beyond that, we could always consider other features like support for more remote providers (e.g., AWS S3, Dropbox) or incremental backups, but based on our conversation, the Google Drive support is the main item that is not yet implemented.
